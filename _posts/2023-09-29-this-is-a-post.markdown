This is a post.

Or more specifically, this is my *first* post. I'm not a writer. I barely use social media. I don't really even know why I'm typing any of this out right now. But at some point in my life I decided that I like to talk a lot and play video games which has led me to...well here.

I am a husband, a father, a software developer, and &mdash; for the last 7 months &mdash; a Twitch streamer. Not really sure where any of it started or when I had done it enough to even consider myself more than just someone of shares live gameplay on the internet. 

But here I am, there you (maybe) are, and this feels like just the beginning of something truly special to me. I hope it can feel the same way for somebody else too.
